                        Vedika,<br><br>
                        I don't think you even realized it back then, but the first time I saw you in 3rd grade, something inside me changed.<br><br>
                        You were just sitting there, smiling so innocently, and I swear‚Ä¶ my heart whispered your name before I even knew what love truly was. I didn't understand what I was feeling, but it was something pure‚Ä¶ something real.<br><br>
                        As we grew up, year after year, my heart kept waiting for the right moment. All those silent days, stolen glances, and quiet prayers‚Ä¶ I kept you in my heart like a secret wish. I watched you laugh, I watched you grow, and with every passing day, my love for you only grew stronger.<br><br>
                        And then came 9th grade.<br><br>
                        I couldn't hold it in anymore. I had waited for so long, and finally, I told you how I felt. That moment changed everything. That little boy from 3rd grade had finally spoken what his heart had been screaming for years: "I love you."<br><br>
                        Now, here we are‚Ä¶ and every second I spend with you feels like magic.<br>
                        But I want more.<br>
                        Not just more days or more memories.<br>
                        I want forever.<br><br>
                        I want to marry you, Vedika.<br>
                        I want to wake up every morning with you by my side.<br>
                        I want to build a home with you, raise our children together, laugh at silly things, hold your hand when we're old, and still say "I love you" like it's the first time.<br><br>
                        You're not just the love of my life. You're the life in my love.<br><br>
                        From the boy who fell in love in 3rd grade,<br>
                        To the man who wants to spend his whole life with you‚Äî<br>
                        It's always been you. And it always will be. üíçüíó
